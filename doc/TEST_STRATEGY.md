## Introduction

This document outlines the **Acceptance Test Strategy** for the API Automation Test Suite developed using [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/). The strategy focuses on ensuring that the API meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment by validating user-related endpoints across different environments (`DEV_HOST` and `RELEASE_HOST`).

## Objectives

- **Validate Business Requirements:** Ensure that the API functionalities align with the defined business needs and specifications.
- **Ensure User Satisfaction:** Confirm that the API provides the expected user experience and meets stakeholder expectations.
- **Facilitate Deployment:** Provide confidence that the API is stable and ready for production release.
- **Identify Critical Issues:** Detect and address any major defects that could impact the API's performance or usability.

## Scope

The acceptance testing strategy encompasses the following aspects:

- **User-Related API Endpoints:** Verification of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for user management.
- **Environment Validation:** Execution of tests in both `DEV_HOST` and `RELEASE_HOST` environments to ensure consistency and reliability.
- **Business Logic Verification:** Ensuring that the API correctly implements the intended business rules and workflows.
- **Security and Authorization:** Validating that authentication mechanisms and access controls function as expected.

## Testing Approach

### Acceptance Testing Process

1. **Test Case Development:**
   - Develop test cases that reflect real-world user scenarios and business requirements.
   - Each test case focuses on validating a specific functionality or user story.

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Configure test environments (`DEV_HOST` and `RELEASE_HOST`) to mirror production settings.
   - Ensure that necessary configurations, such as authentication tokens and endpoints, are correctly set.

3. **Test Execution:**
   - Execute test cases using Robot Framework to interact with the API endpoints.
   - Perform CRUD operations and verify responses against expected outcomes.

4. **Result Validation:**
   - Assess whether the API responses meet the acceptance criteria.
   - Log and document any discrepancies or defects encountered during testing.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Generate comprehensive reports summarizing test results, including passed and failed cases.
   - Provide insights and recommendations based on the test outcomes.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **Robot Framework:**
  - Serves as the primary automation tool for developing and executing acceptance test cases.
  
- **RequestsLibrary:**
  - Facilitates HTTP requests, enabling interaction with API endpoints.
  
- **FakerLibrary:**
  - Generates realistic test data to simulate user interactions and scenarios.
  
- **Collections Library:**
  - Assists in handling and manipulating data structures within test cases.
  
- **OperatingSystem Library:**
  - Manages interactions with the operating system, such as environment variable handling.

## Test Environment

- **Development Environment (`DEV_HOST`):**
  - Used for initial acceptance testing during the development phase.
  - Allows for early detection and resolution of issues before moving to release.

- **Release Environment (`RELEASE_HOST`):**
  - Mirrors the production environment to validate the API's readiness for deployment.
  - Ensures that the API performs consistently across different stages.

## Test Data Management

- **Data Generation:**
  - Utilize `FakerLibrary` to create diverse and realistic test data, covering various user scenarios.
  
- **Data Isolation:**
  - Ensure that test data does not interfere across different test cases by isolating data within each test.

- **Data Cleanup:**
  - Implement teardown procedures to remove or reset test data after execution, maintaining a clean state for subsequent tests.

## Reporting

- **Report Generation:**
  - After test execution, Robot Framework generates detailed reports highlighting the outcomes of each test case.
  
- **Report Contents:**
  - **Summary:** Overview of passed and failed tests, along with execution statistics.
  - **Detailed Logs:** Step-by-step logs providing insights into each test case's execution flow.
  
- **Accessibility:**
  - Store reports in the designated `reports/` directory for easy access and review by stakeholders.

## Conclusion

The **Acceptance Test Strategy** is pivotal in ensuring that the API meets the defined business requirements and is ready for deployment. By focusing on user-related endpoints and validating them across multiple environments, this strategy provides confidence in the API's functionality, reliability, and security. Leveraging Robot Framework and its associated libraries facilitates efficient and comprehensive acceptance testing, ultimately contributing to the delivery of a robust and user-friendly API.
